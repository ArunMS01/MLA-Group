One of the key players in the PVC additives industry, we have been the preferred&nbsp;<strong>PVC heat stabilizer suppliers in the world</strong>, supplying high performance stabilizers to a large number of PVC manufacturing companies across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are committed to providing our customers best quality products at competitive prices. With fast and reliable supplies, we have grown into the most reliable brand in the industry, established trust based relations with leading PVC processors worldwide, and have become a&nbsp;<strong>leading PVC heat stabilizers suppliers and exporters in the world</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Product - Pvc Heat Stabilizers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We provide PVC Heat Stabilizers (one packs - lead based &amp; calcium-zinc non-toxic) in powder and flakes form. In PVC Processing (extrusion, injection molding, etc.), the polymer is subjected to a high temperature which can lead to burning (degradation or breaking of polymer chains). Heat stabilizers are lead compounds that are added to prevent burning by capturing and inactivating the labile chlorine that is produced on heating of PVC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conventionally, a combination of three chemicals, TBLS, DBLS, and LS (Tribasic lead sulphate, dibasic Lead stearate, and Lead stearate) were used as heat stabilizers along with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mlagroup.com/calcium-stearate-manufacturers.html\">Calcium Stearate&nbsp;</a>as a co-stabilizer. MLA Group is the leading manufacture of these&nbsp;<strong>single stabilizers</strong>&nbsp;in the highest purity and performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowadays, one&ndash;pack stabilizer is used in place of the three chemicals as a heat stabilizer. It is made by in-situ reaction of lead oxide with stearic acid along with many other components like waxes, antioxidants, inorganic stabilizers etc, which were not there in the conventional system of single stabilizers above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its performance depends on two things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>the lead oxide content which provides stabilization by deactivating the chloride radical formed during heated melt processing of PVC during extrusion and</li>\r\n	<li>by providing lubrication so that the residence time inside the screw extruder (heated zone) is reduced, so less deterioration is there.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>MLA Group produces a dozen of popular one-pack grades with different lead contents as well as over a hundred customized grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Choose Us as Your Pvc Heat Stabilizers Suppliers in India</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MLA Group of Industries has been a leading name as&nbsp;<strong>PVC heat stabilizer manufacturers in the world</strong>, known for providing products that are backed by a superior quality guarantee and that conform to international standards.

It has the general formula Al2,(Si2O5)(OH)4. It is a hydrated alumino-silicate having sheet structure. Free Silica (grit) is the most undesirable impurity and is removed during processing by levigation, sedimentation or air-separation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Deposits</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>High grade china clay deposits are present in West Bengal, Orissa, Rajasthan, M.P. &amp; Gujarat. First we collect the samples from various mines which is analysed for composition and physical and chemical properties and its suitability for various applications is then studied. Moreover, sustained availability of the material with no variation from mines is given utmost importance to ensure consistency in final product.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Processing of China Clay</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The raw china clay is subject to a refining process including spiral classification, hydrocycloning, deflocculation, bleaching and finally drying, micronizing, air-classification and surface treatment. Our processing ensures consistent composition, control of top-cut and average particle size and freedom from free silica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our quality assurance system extends from mining to micronizing to ensure near-Zero-defect products :-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mining</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Manual sorting to recover white lumps.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">On site chemical analysis before despatch to our factories.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Micronizing</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Test for physical properties like Bulk density, Oil absorption, Whiteness etc.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Particle - size distribution analysis.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Surface Treatment</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Testing of hydrophobicity, oil absorption and uniformity of coating.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Quality Test Certification</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Quality Test Certificate is provided to customers, certifying values within specifications.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#000000\">Services</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"color:#000000\">Fritsch Analysette (for Particle Size Distribution Analysis)</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.mlagroup.com/images/fritschimage.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Sem &amp; Xrd Machine (for Observation of Particle Morphology and Elemental Composition)</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.mlagroup.com/images/machine.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Just-in-time inventory management support by despatch from ready stock.</li>\r\n	<li>Before sales technical feedback and problem solving in collaboration with the customer by our technical service engineers.</li>\r\n	<li>Application development at customer&#39;s end supported by the central R&amp;D laboratory of MLA Group.</li>\r\n	<li>After sales services &amp; trouble-shooting by the sales &amp; service engineers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tulsi-052 Extra White Clay</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This grade has a whiteness unmatched by any other clay available worldwide.

We are also known as leading Zinc Oxide Manufacturers in India. We are known to be a supplier of Zinc Oxide at very competitive prices. Organic accelerators used in rubber compounding are almost always dependant on the presence of activators. Zinc Oxide is the most important of such activators.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Zincosil Nk-a and Nk-t</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Because of their very small particle sizes zinc-oxide active &amp; transparent (NK-A &amp; NK-T) cause very powerful activation of the cure. Depending on the type and amount of accelerator present they can considerably delay the onset of cure without simultaneously extending the total curing time.</li>\r\n	<li>Because of stronger activating effect, the amount of this substance needed for the same modulus is lesser as compared to ordinary Zinc Oxide.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike ordinary Zinc-Oxide, ZINCOSIL NK-T is compatible with the production of transparent goods as it does not impair the transparency of the vulcanizates when added in small and moderately large amounts.</li>\r\n	<li>They cause no changes in the colour of the vulcanizates. They reduce yellowing in white and light coloured goods which are exposed to strong light.</li>\r\n	<li>As they do not have pigmenting properties, they do not influence effect of colour pigments provided they are not too heavily loaded.</li>\r\n	<li>Due to exceptionally low lead compound contents they are particularly suitable for vulcanizates intended to be practically free from heavy metals.</li>\r\n	<li>They do not boom.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Packing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>(25 kgs) In new laminated H.D.P.E. bags with loose polythene liner inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Incorporation / Usage</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Owing to the fineness of particles, ZINCOSIL NK-A and NK-T are very easy to incorporate and disperse well.</li>\r\n	<li>They raise the viscosity of the mix. Large additions stiffen the mix considerabely.</li>\r\n	<li>As their propertion is increased, the thermal conductivity of rubber mixes is raised which is an advantage in hot air curing.</li>\r\n	<li>In large proportions, zinc-oxide active, NK-A behaves like a reinforcing filler. It gives vulcanizates high tensile strength and rebound resilience with a simultaneous increase in hardness. It also imparts resistance to ageing and protection against flex-cracking.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Use Zinc Oxide (Activated / Transparent)</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Our strong technical background in terms of R &amp; D facilities and scientific personnel has enabled us to optimize our production cost to provide you the best possible quality at a very reasonable price.</li>\r\n	<li>Equipped with a rubber laboratory, we have modified our product to give an excellent combination of various desirable properties in rubber.</li>\r\n	<li>Fineness of particles or surface area is the most important property which determines activity. We have optimised the surface area to give best results in rubber.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Active Zinc Oxide is Superior to Conventional White Seal Zinc Oxide( 99.5 % ) Because</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>White seal has a surface area only 5 sq mtr/gm whereas active has 40-50 sq mtr/gm, so its reactivity in rubber vulcanization complex formation is much better and it can be used in lower dosage upto 40 % in different grades.</li>\r\n	<li>Where as white seal can have lead and other heavy metals upto 2500 ppm, active zinc oxide has below 20 ppm. So there is no lead blackening, no microwave defects and no ageing deterioration in properties.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Zincosil T -150 against Lanxess</strong>&nbsp;( Zno 93-95, surface area 40-50 sq mtr / gm ) : This grade can be used 30-40 % less dosage easily.

The properties have been optimized in our different grades according to the application.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Advantages of Our Products in Paints</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Part of white pigment like Titanium-dioxide (10% or more) can be replaced without loss of opacity.</li>\r\n	<li>Give faster surface and through-drying in product which also stand up better to abrasive treatment.</li>\r\n	<li>Excellent substrates for high gloss finishes as they ensure good levelling out.</li>\r\n	<li>Give excellent thicksotropy and facilitate dripless application.</li>\r\n	<li>Act as anti-setting agents for pigments and fillers. The viscosity of decorative paints containing our product is highly constant over extended periods of time. Being basic, they also have positive effect on storage stability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Advantages in Rubber</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The particles of the filler used interact with the polymer, thus changing the properties of the mix and vulcanized material. For a filler with definite chemical composition, this interaction becomes more intensive as the surface area of the filler particles increases.Due to fine micronization of our products, they have very large surface area and thus give excellent properties in terms of tensile strength, modulus and resistance to tear and abrasion. They are particularly suitable for soling and microcellular sheets as they give relatively fast cures and enable production of soling materials to be streamlined.</p>\r\n', '<p><a href=\"https://www.mlagroup.com/download/tulsi/AL_SILICATE_combined_specs.pdf\">Download Specifications</a></p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td colspan=\"7\"><span style=\"color:#ffffff; font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:small\"><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">TYPICAL PHYSIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ALUMINIUM SILICATES</span></strong></span></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><strong><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:small\">Property</span></strong></td>\r\n			<td><strong><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:small\">Unit</span></strong></td>\r\n			<td><strong><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:small\">Super Special Grade</span></strong></td>\r\n			<td><strong><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:small\">Special Grade </span></strong></td>\r\n			<td><strong><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:small\">Super Grade </span></strong></td>\r\n			<td><strong><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:small\">Comm.

For medicinal purposes, it is used as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but over-consumption could be harmful and lead to poor digestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also manufactured synthetically by passing carbon dioxide through hydrated lime to give a comparatively lighter product with lower bulk density.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are required to be stored in well-closed containers.

It is broadly found in metamorphic, sedimentary, and igneous rocks. Calcite is a common component of sedimentary rocks like limestone and marble.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Aragonite:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It is less stable and more soluble in comparison to calcite. Biological and physical procedures like precipitation by freshwater and marine helps in the formation of aragonite. It is generally used for removing the pollutants like cobalt, zinc, and lead from polluted wastewaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Vaterite:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaterite is usually hexagonal in shape and is less stable than both the minerals calcite as well as aragonite but solubility is higher.

The company has a production capacity of 3000 tons per month. One of the key players in the PVC additives industry, we have been the preferred&nbsp;<strong>PVC heat stabilizer suppliers in the world</strong>, supplying high performance stabilizers to a large number of PVC manufacturing companies across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are committed to providing our customers best quality products at competitive prices.

In PVC Processing (extrusion, injection molding, etc.), the polymer is subjected to a high temperature which can lead to burning (degradation or breaking of polymer chains). Heat stabilizers are lead compounds that are added to prevent burning by capturing and inactivating the labile chlorine that is produced on heating of PVC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conventionally, a combination of three chemicals, TBLS, DBLS, and LS (Tribasic lead sulphate, dibasic Lead stearate, and Lead stearate) were used as heat stabilizers along with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mlagroup.com/calcium-stearate-manufacturers.html\">Calcium Stearate&nbsp;</a>as a co-stabilizer. MLA Group is the leading manufacture of these&nbsp;<strong>single stabilizers</strong>&nbsp;in the highest purity and performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowadays, one&ndash;pack stabilizer is used in place of the three chemicals as a heat stabilizer. It is made by in-situ reaction of lead oxide with stearic acid along with many other components like waxes, antioxidants, inorganic stabilizers etc, which were not there in the conventional system of single stabilizers above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its performance depends on two things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;the lead oxide content which provides stabilization by deactivating the chloride radical formed during heated melt processing of PVC during extrusion and</li>\r\n	<li>by providing lubrication so that the residence time inside the screw extruder (heated zone) is reduced, so less deterioration is there.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>MLA Group produces a dozen of popular one-pack grades with different lead contents as well as over a hundred customized grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Choose Us as Your PVC Heat Stabilizers Suppliers In India</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>MLA Group of Industries has been a leading name as&nbsp;<strong>PVC heat stabilizer manufacturers in the world</strong>, known for providing products that are backed by a superior quality guarantee and that conform to international standards.

If the filler is more, the dosage required is more.
